<h1>About Me</h1>

<img src="../assets/images/me.png" alt="photo of me" style="height: 200px; width: 200px;">

<p>Hello! I’m Daniel Epshtein, a 31-year-old Jerusalem native with a passion for logistics and technology. <br>
  I proudly served in the IDF for 10 years as a technical equipment officer, honing my skills and gaining invaluable experience. <br>
  After earning my bachelor’s degree in logistics, I transitioned into the professional services sector at Hiper Global, where I continue to apply my expertise and grow professionally.
  </p>
  
<p> On a personal note, I’m happily married to my wonderful wife, Liel. <br>
  We tied the knot on January 5, 2023, and are now excitedly awaiting the arrival of our baby boy, with Liel entering her third trimester this Sunday. <br>
  In my spare time, I’m expanding my skill set by studying Full Stack development on the Udemy platform. <br>
  I believe in lifelong learning and am always looking for ways to improve and innovate. Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
